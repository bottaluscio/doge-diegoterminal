**T0gn3k** is the reason why you are here, don't ask why.

All of this is a fork of the awesome [doge terminal][dogeterminal] much credit to the creators.

## Features

* Randomly placed and colored random strings, complete with broken english.
* Awesome **T0gn3k** in the terminal.
* All the goodies from doge terminal

## Installation

`python setup.py install` should be just fine for that.

Note that if you are one of the unlucky doges to still run a Python that does
not have argparse (<=Python2.6) you will have to install argparse manually from
pypi. so old, very update need.

Then, just add a call to `doge` at the bottom of your shell rc file.

## Notes

You need a terminal that supports 256 colors running on a system that supports
unicode.

The terminal Shibe was created with hax0r Gimp skills and [img2xterm][i2x].
